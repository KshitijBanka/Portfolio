            <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
           <div class="line"></div>
            <p id="p">I have many hobbies including Football(Soccer), Cricket, Reading, Coding, Hockey, Basketball, Tennis, Writing stories, and the list goes on and on.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>I play basketball and tennis every morning from either 6:15 am to 7:30 am, or 6: 45 am to 8 am. It totally depends when I wake up.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I used to play Cricket and football with my friedns almost everyday, until the Covid-19 Pandemic started a spoiled everything. I play cricket, football and hockey for my school team, and used to be part of the swimming one.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I love doing coding classes with Whitehat Jr. It's very engaging, and a lot of fun to make websites and apps. I learn a lot of new things from block-coding, to text-base. I started off with simple loops and move forward blocks, but now I've reached complicated topics like Bootstraps and Webpage Development. In my journey with WHitehat, I learnt to make a simple app on Code.org, creating chatbots, Chat Apps and now Webpage Development.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>I absolutely love reading. I like to read many book series including Percy Jackson, The Famous Five, Goosebumps, Horrible Sciencs, Harry Potter, Geronimo Stilton, Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Tom Gates, Timmy Failure, and MANY more. It's a never-ending list!</p>
